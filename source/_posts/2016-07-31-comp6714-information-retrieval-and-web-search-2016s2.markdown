**week1**    
Missing the course because of the late flight :(    
But the lab online is well designed and fun.     
I even submitted a pull request to lecturer :)

**week2**    
Getting most of the ideas, but totally lost in some math parts,  having not learned math for so many years.

**week4**    
I force myself to concentrate and followed the lecture quite well.      
Maybe another reason is that the lecture is much clearer this week.

**week7&8 Spelling Correction + Information Extraction**    
The lecture back to a mess.. I was lost...      
I occationaly heard one classmate judging Wang that he alway jump from one point to another, for example, when he was talking about A,  he suddenly remembered B, he would jump to B, then again, jumped to C, then back to A.      
The point is that he should make one thing totally clear before jumping to another. He is a good and responsible researcher but he should do more efforts to become a lecturer as goog as Rymon Wong.
