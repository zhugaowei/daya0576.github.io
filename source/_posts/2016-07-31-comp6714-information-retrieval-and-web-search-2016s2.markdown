**week1**    
Missing the course because of the late flight :(    
But the lab online is well designed and fun.     
I even submitted a pull request to lecturer :)

**week2**    
Getting most of the ideas, but totally lost in some math parts,  having not learned math for so many years.

**week4**    
I force myself to concentrate on the lecture and followed the lecture quite well.      
Maybe another reason is that the lecture is much clearer this week.
