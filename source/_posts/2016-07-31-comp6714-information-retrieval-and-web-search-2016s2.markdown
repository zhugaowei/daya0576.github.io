>### In the end ###
----------
**Summery**     
**Good things**:    
1. Well designed lab(Jupyter Notebook) on github are excellent: [https://github.com/DBWangGroupUNSW/COMP6714](https://github.com/DBWangGroupUNSW/COMP6714)     
2. Distribution of whole class mark are provided.    
**Should be improved**:

**week1**    
I missed the first lecture because of the late flight :(    
But the lab online is **well designed and fun**, it does help me have a deeper understand of the algorithms in lecture.           
I even submitted a pull request to lecturer :)

**week2**     
Getting most of the ideas, but totally lost in some math parts,  having not learned math for so many years.     
Another problem is that Wang looked a bit nervous and cannot make some of the teaching content totally clear, speaking hundreds of "**actually**" in the 3 hours lecture.

**week4**    
I forced myself to concentrate and followed the lecture quite well.      
Maybe another reason is that the lecture is much clearer this week.

**week6 Compression**    
Can not wait to learn knowledge from this course!     
happiest moment in my horrible 9 hours' lecture on Monday!

**week7&8 Spelling Correction + Information Extraction**    
The lecture back to a mess. I was lost again...      
I heard one classmate judging Wang that he alway jump from one point to another, for example, when he was talking about A,  he suddenly remembered B, he would rush to B, then again, jumped to C, finally back to A.      
The point is that he should make one thing entirely clear before jumping to another thing. He is a good and responsible **teacher**, but he should make more efforts to become a **lecturer** such as Raymond Wong.        
Of course, another reason is my lacking of preparation, I should spend more time to prepare before the lecture!!!

**Assignment1**    
[Ass1(click me to download)](/images/blog/160731_comp6714/ass1-spec.pdf) is consisted of four questions.     
Here is my solution: [ass1_solution.pdf](/images/blog/160731_comp6714/ass1.pdf)     
My mark: Comment: 24 | 14 | 25 | 25 | 1     
The most awesome part is that, when the mark of ass1 released, lectuer give the overview(mark distribution) of the whole class:

**Project**     
[A copy of project spec](/images/blog/160731_comp6714/proj1-spec.pdf)     
Quite interesting, extracting birthday and parents in sentences such as:     
`Waite, the eldest of five children, was born in White Plains, New York on June 22, 1928, to Ralph H. Waite, a construction engineer, and Esther (nee Mitchell) Waite.`    
It's not hard to get a not bad result, but if you pursue the perfect performance, you need a smarter way to deal with the data, such as parsing the sentence to dependency tree and analyze the syntax.     
**Submitting System**    
BTW, the submitting system online is awesome!!!      
U have ten chances to submit and get your mark, it's so nice(compared with 9319...).      
However, many students complained about this submitting system.. If u spend some time to read the spec carefully and simply follow the steps, nothing should go wrong.

The evaluation measure is also brilliant

**Project summary**    
As today is the due date of project, I will summarize my thinkings about this project:     
I mentioned a lot of things above that I extremely appreciate, here are things have to be improved in my perspective:             
1. Mistakes in testing and training data:     
Lecturer's response to this issue:     
<img style="max-height:344px" class="lazy" data-original="/images/blog/160731_comp6714/explain.png">    
However, I still feel the testing and training data has to be more correct. It's because there were only 400 sentences, rahter than 4000, and most of the mistakes in training data are easy for human to distinguish.      
Another critical reason is that these mistakes would make student lose confidence on testing data(highly relevent to their marks..).       
And I kept thinking that one solution is opening a thread in class forum or github and let students to submit all the possible errors, then keep publishing the latest most correct version of data.     
Unfortunately, it's not feasible for testing data(can not be seen by students).     
2. Late reply in piazza forum    
I understand that Dr. Wang was extremely busy this semester(as he mentioned many time in lecture.) This forum should be checked everyday although some of the questions quite naive and wasting time to answer.

** week11 Evaluation **    
Really enjoy the first two hours, the evaluation is full of fun and easy.    
<img style="max-height:400px" class="lazy" data-original="/images/blog/160731_comp6714/w11_wei.png">    
However, in the last one hour, I was lost in math part again @_@ (Probablistic and Language Models)         
And the lecture ended at 15:01, 6 minutes extended, one critical thing and fact are that this 6 minutes would not be recorded. It was not a big issue, and I can see that Dr. Wang did eager to deliver a great teaching, but he also has to pay more attention to these **details** to improve "user happiness" :)

** Assignment2 **    
So so so interesting, I have been playing it for the whole day.    
The difficulty of the questions are well controlled, I mean u all the problems are very hard, but it can be solved if u spend some time on it.     
The pleasure of solving each question is unblievable.    
** Mark for Project **      
I only spent one day to get this result, but then spend 4 days without improvement.
