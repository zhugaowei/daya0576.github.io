**week1**    
First lecture of this semester, extremely favor of this lecturer, he is so cool and has a strong personality!      
He mentioned the history of some knowledge and encourage us to learn them because in the past decades, we made so many mistakes, knowing more history helps us avoid mistakes.      
So impressive.

Teaching the examples of egrep, pip, cut, wc etc to handle text files.     
Not fun, but the lecturer made these content quite enjoyable to learn.           
Haha, some teachers do have the talent of making our lives easier.
