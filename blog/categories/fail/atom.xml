    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Some courses in UNSW are so hard, and failing a course doesn&rsquo;t mean the end of the world. However, there is limited info online(because I searched before and got nothing), so I decided to write this blog to share my experience and advises.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><strong>So what to do when you fail a course, but next semester should be your last semester?</strong></p></blockquote>

<br>  


<blockquote><p><strong> option 1: Enrolling in summer term.</strong>  <br/>
UNSW offers courses in <a href="http://timetable.unsw.edu.au/2016/KENSUGRDU1.html">summer teaching period</a>, however only some courses are opened in this special period. For example, cse even do not offer courses in summer teaching period, but if u r 8543 student, fortunately u have Non-CSE Electives, which means u have an opportunity to enroll in any course(any subject) in UNSW.   <br/>

<br> 


<blockquote><p><strong> option 2: Overloading.</strong>  <br/>
Overloading means you can do five courses in one term, sounds good, but I think it&rsquo;s highly not recommended, because what should you do if you fail again?</p></blockquote>

<br> 


<blockquote><p><strong> Advises: </strong>  <br/>
1. The first and also most important, be extremely careful in enrolling a course. U have the freedom to enrol and drop a course without financial and academic penalty in week1, so try any more course as possible and find one that perfect for u.   <br/>
2. Seeking help from cse office, the staff there are so kind and patient, and they care you and give you the best advice. I learnt all the things from them.   <br/>
